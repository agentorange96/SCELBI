This follows the dimensions of the original BUD case that has been long discontinued. (Only a shorter variant is available today.) It includes the following extra features:
- Cut-out for the backplane
- Pilot holes for the IO

This file can be edited in Protocase's Protocase Designer. You may consider:
- Pre-drilling the holes for the backplane (I didn't trust myself to align these properly)
- Pre-shaping the IO holes to avoid buying an expensive punch that you will likely never use again
