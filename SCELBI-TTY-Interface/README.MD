This is a [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) project. Generated gerber files can be purchased from your choice of PCB manufacturer. I recommend 4PCB for this project as you can order without a solder mask to match the SCELBI aesthetic.

The original schematic comes from Mike Willegal's blog post found [here](https://www.willegal.net/blog/?p=4459) where he creates an RS232 interface. I adapted the design to a SCELBI-style card with the aim to make it look as much like the original TTY card as possible. This card is pin-compatible with the TTY card and should be able to be swapped into a TTY interface box.

**PLEASE NOTE**
- This design is working, however
- Holes for the capacitor and the diode are narrow
- The pinout may not match that of the original TTY interface as intended
- These issues should be fixed in a future revision
