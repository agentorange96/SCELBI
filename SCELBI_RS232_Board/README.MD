This is a [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org/) project. Generated gerber files can be purchased from your choice of PCB manufacturer. I recommend 4PCB for this project as you can order without a solder mask to match the SCELBI aesthetic.

The original schematic comes from Mike Willegal's blog post found [here](https://www.willegal.net/blog/?p=4459) where he creates an RS232 interface. I adapted the design to a SCELBI-style card with the aim to make it look as much like the original TTY card as possible. This card is pin-compatible with the TTY card and should be able to be swapped into a TTY interface box.

**PLEASE NOTE I HAVE NOT TESTED THIS CARD YET!!!**
I do not yet have my 1702A's programmed, so I have not tested this. I should have a programmer soon and will be able to test this design.
