The original design comes from [Mike Willegal](https://www.willegal.net/) who provided me the design file for the blank front panel. I added text and set it to be engraved. **This is not historically accurate!** 

This file can be edited in FPE's Front Panel Designer. You may consider:
- Changing the engraving to screen printing for historical accuracy
- Changing "SCELBI-8B" to "SCELBI-8H" depending on your build.
